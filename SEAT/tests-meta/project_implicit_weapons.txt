The Project Implicit IAT consisted of pictures of items and pictures
faces; the terms here are descriptions of those items and ad-hoc
terms from the skin tone IAT.  Note that the category names for this
IAT are different (Black, White American versus Dark, Light); we use
the same set of terms for simplicity, considering the similarity
between the two sets.
