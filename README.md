# Re-Evaluating-Bias

## Set-up

### General
In `models` folder create separate folders for each LM, named `elmo`, `bert`, and `gpt2`, respectively. Additionally, create a single folder in the `bert` folder named `base-cased`. This structure accounts for possible future enhancements to other LMs and specifically BERT versions. Save the required files for loading a LM from your local machine in the respective folder. 

### CEAT
create folder 'raw_data' to save all 12 bz2 files containing reddit comment from 2014
create folders 'dict_files' & 'data_files' if you run comment_* python code scripts
end results are in data_files or can be directly downloaded from kaggle dataset (LINK HERE, make dataset public)
--> insert here description of generation process includ. structure of files.
